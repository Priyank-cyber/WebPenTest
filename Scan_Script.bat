REM Docker terminal starts from user directory hence files referenced are present there.
REM Other paths are specified as per my own computer so please change them appropriately.
REM This script uses the Java XML to SQL program.
REM Arguement provided in program execution is the path of XML file to be parsed. (in my system they are named as tr1,tr2 etc.)
REM Java prog only needs to be compiled once so the javac command can be excluded after one successful execution.
REM Docker Quickstart Terminal shortcut must be present in present working directory for this script to work.
